# Overview
Day 2 was more work on the blog and I also fell down the rabbit hole and saw a few interesting youtube videos one of them being how you would go about designing a system for tinder which is my first resource below. Also I will be building a portfolio website with a tutorial I found on youtube which I will list below in the resources.
