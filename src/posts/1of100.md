# Overview
Day 1 is building a blog using Gatsby. I had done a Gatsby youtube bootcamp pretty recently so I just used a lot of the code I had worked on then. Hoping to share my experience with 100 Days of Gatsby! It was a bit challenging undoing some of the stuff we did during the bootcamp without breaking thingds but I got it working. There is still a huge amount of things that are needed to improve the site which I will list in a seperate page (probably [Plan](/plan/)).

#### Problems to Overcome or Tasks to complete
- Removing some of the stuff we added during Andrew Mead's bootcamp to remove Contentful as the CMS and revert back to using Markdown files for posts.
- Adding some visual improvements.
- Hosting it with either Netlify or Github Pages.

#### Things I loved
- Using some of the tools Gatsby provides out the box like their Link function or how you can create pages super easily.
- The feel and speed of the site when I use it.
