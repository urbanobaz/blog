# Overview
Day 4 was all about work for a client. Started working on a website redesign so I was on that all day. Got plenty of things done but there's never a shortage of tasks on the list. All in all, I love this and I'm grateful I get to do something I love everyday. It's a Python based project so we'll be using Flask, Jinja, HTML & CSS.

#### Problems to Overcome or Tasks to complete
- Basically everything to be completed on the client's page.
- Better styling for the blog.
- Edit/Add content to Home, About, and Plan pages on the blog.

#### Things I loved
- Flask & Python, still.
